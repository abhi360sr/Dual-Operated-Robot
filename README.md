# Dual-Operated-Robot
 DTMF-controlled mobile robot: Operated via phone keypad tones, it interprets dual-tone signals to maneuver. Ideal for remote operations, surveillance, and exploration.




DETAILS:

A DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency) controlled mobile robot is a versatile robotic system that responds to commands sent through a phone keypad or similar interface using DTMF tones. These tones are a combination of two distinct frequencies, generated by pressing specific keys on a keypad. The robot's control system interprets these tones and translates them into corresponding actions, such as moving forward, backward, turning, or stopping.

Typically, the DTMF-controlled mobile robot consists of a chassis equipped with motors, wheels, a microcontroller (such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi), a DTMF decoder circuit, and a receiver module. The DTMF decoder circuit detects the tones generated by pressing keys on the keypad and converts them into digital signals that the microcontroller can understand.
